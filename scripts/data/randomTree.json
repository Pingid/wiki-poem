The marketing mix has been defined as the \"set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market\". Thus the marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: product, price, promotion, and place.  Marketing practice has been occurring for millennia, but marketing theory emerged in the early twentieth century. The contemporary marketing mix, or the 4 Ps, which has become the dominant framework for marketing management decisions, was first published in 1960. In services marketing, an extended marketing mix is used, typically comprising 7 Ps, made up of the original 4 Ps extended by process, people, and physical evidence. Occasionally service marketers will refer to 8 Ps, comprising these 7 Ps plus performance.In the 1990s, the model of 4 Cs was introduced as a more customer-driven replacement of the 4 Ps.There are two theories based on 4 Cs: Lauterborn's 4 Cs , and Shimizu's 4 Cs .Given the valuation of customers towards potential product attributes  and the attributes of the products sold by other companies, the problem of selecting the attributes of a product to maximize the number of customers preferring it is a computationally intractable problem.The correct arrangement of marketing mix by enterprise marketing managers plays an important role in the success of corporate marketing: develop strengths and avoid weaknesses strengthen the competitiveness and adaptability of enterprises make the internal departments of the enterprise work closely togetherThe origins of the 4 Ps can be traced to the late 1940s. The first known mention of a mix  has been attributed to a Professor of Marketing at Harvard University, Prof. James Culliton. In 1948, Culliton published an article entitled, The Management of Marketing Costs in which Culliton describes marketers as 'mixers of ingredients'. Some years later, Culliton's colleague, Professor Neil Borden, published a retrospective article detailing the early history of the marketing mix in which he claims that he was inspired by Culliton's idea of 'mixers', and credits himself with popularising the concept of  the 'marketing mix'. According to Borden's account, he used the term, 'marketing mix' consistently from the late 1940s. For instance, he is known to have used the term 'marketing mix' in his presidential address given to the American Marketing Association","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Marketing_Association","parents":[{"title":"Distribution (marketing)","text":"Distribution  is one of the four elements of the marketing mix","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix","parents":[{"title":"Broadcasting","text":"Broadcasting is the distribution","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)","parents":[{"title":"Broadcast programming","text":"Broadcast","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast","parents":[{"title":"Dayparting","text":"In broadcast programming","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_programming","parents":[{"title":"Late night television","text":"Late night television is one of the dayparts","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayparting","parents":[{"title":"Late-night talk show","text":"A late-night","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_night_television","parents":[{"title":"The Daily Show","text":"The Daily Show is an American late-night talk","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-night_talk_show","parents":[{"title":"Jim Margolis (producer)","text":"Jim Margolis is an American producer, writer, and director.
